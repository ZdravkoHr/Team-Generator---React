## What is the purpose of this app?


The app divides people whom names are provided by the user into teams on a random basis.

## How does the app work?


In order to get the desired teams, you must fill in the names of the members, each on a new line, and also, how many teams do you want to be formed. Optionally, you can provide names for the teams. After you have filled in the necessary information, click the "Generate teams" button. A notification will pop up in the bottom right corner of the screen. If there are no problems, by clicking on the notification, you will open the Team Board. Otherwise, check again the provided information.

*An error may occur if you:*

  1. have submitted the form without filling in all the neccessary fields;
  2. are trying to generate an invalid amount of teams - either more than the count of the members or less than 1;
  3. have filled in something different than an integer in the filed where you are supposed to let the app knows how many teams do you want to form;

## Menu

In the menu, you will find several options: 

  1. information about the app - opens the information window about the app - the one you are reading right now;
  2. an icon which opens the Team Board when clicked;
  3. settings about the preffered way to generate teams.
